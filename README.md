# EE443 Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) Final Project
## Huy Huynh and Richard Tran

### A Deep-Sort like Tracking Algorithm
The tracking algorithm take into account the embedded feature and motion of the object during association. The implementation assumes that the creation of the detection and embedded feature are already done.

### Requirements
- python==3.8
- numpy 
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- opencv
